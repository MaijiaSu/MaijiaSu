I am a PhD student in Civil Engineering with "standard" skills such as finite element modeling and structural dynamic analysis. My research interests explore efficient uncertainty quantification techniques and their application in engineering. My PhD program focuses on stochastic ground motion modeling that is statistically compatible with historical records.
